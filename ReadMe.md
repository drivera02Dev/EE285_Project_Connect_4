## Connect 4 

This is a connect 4 program that starts with a menu with two different choices with either player vs player or Challenge mode where you can challenge an AI to a game of connect 4. 

## Compile

1. Type:
   >
```bash
./Connect4Game
```
2. Hit `Enter`

## Controls 

Menu: 
1. `Up and Down arrow keys` to pick a mode. 
2. `Enter` to select your mode.


Game: 
1. `Left` and `Right` arrows to move your cursor 
2. `Down arrow key` to select what column you want your piece to be in.

## AI 

The AI does make moves however it doesn't make the best possible move. (Incomplete)

## Role Played

My role in this project was to make sure that the arrays of the playing board were displayed correctly using the NCurses libarary and to make sure that there could be no issues when putting down a piece on the board such as an array being overwritten or not being registerd by the cursor. I also tried helping in creating the AI by using a model called alpha beta pruning however we were unsuccessful in implementing it with the alloted time we had. Since this was my first engineering project I gained a sense on how it was to work in an engineering enviorment for the first time with other people.
